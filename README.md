<p>I am a triplet born and raised as a twin as one triplet sadly passed away just
after birth. I am a vibrant mum of two teenagers, and I think an awesome mum and
wife, well I keep the household running smoothly at least and no one dies
throughout any given day!!!. I am Australian born, born in Brisbane, Queensland.
I completed year 12 in 1997. I have completed a certificate 3 in Dental
Assisting, Certificate 3 in Sterilisation and back many years ago a Certificate
2 in Information Technology. I am fluent in the English language maybe some
Australian slang thrown in . I crochet in my spare time and enjoy playing the
Xbox.</p>

              <h1>Interests in IT</h1>
<hr style="border:2px solid teal"> </hr>

              <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>

<p>My interest in Information Technology started back whilst I was at school in 1995/ 1996 studying computers as a
subject for high school. I remember the teacher walking into the classroom with
a large box (mobile phone back then) and then somewhere in the lesson connecting
to the world wide web. It was then that my imagination was running wild at the
possibilities of the future and what could potentially happen with computers and
information technology.</p>


              <h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>

<p>My interest in IT started in a computing subject at high school in 1995 or 1996.
Shortly after I acquired my first mobile phone. This was my first mobile phone.
<div class="first mobile phone">
        <div id="first mobile phone">
            <img src="first mobile phone.jpeg"/>
      </div>
<p>I remember this magic moment in technology like it was yesterday, if only I had
kept the phone to compare it to today technology.</p>

                <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>

<p>My computer teacher seemed so knowledgeable with computers, he was so passionate
about the subject that he and the whole world wide web sparked my interest.</P>

                <h3>Outline your IT experience?</h3>

<p>I don’t really have any experience in IT apart from my everyday use since that
time at school in my computing class. I guess I use IT every day, to purchase
good at the shops, use of my smart phone every day. Using the laptop to type
this assessment. I guess I use IT more than I realise for tasks that we complete
everyday even without realising.</P>

                  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

<p>I was just googling, as we do on the internet. I have always been interested in
computers and RMIT was the first page that came up. I clicked and enrolled. I
spoke with a customer service officer from OUA (Open Universities Australia). I
liked the idea of swapping and changing between full time and part time degree.
I was originally looking at cert 3 in Information technology at TAFE, but I
thought why do Certificate 3? why not see what university has to offer.</P>

                    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p>I expect to learn about computers and stream into a particular area of interest
once enrolled into the Bachelor of IT. I am still unsure about where I am headed
in the IT world. I have worked with 3D graphics and bringing them to life from
architect plans. I am sort of interested in help desk, cyber security, coding,
graphics and gaming all at the same time. I just like computers and how they
make our lives a little easier, unlike back in the day of a paper trail.</P>

<h2>Test Two</h2>

<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/learning-style-quiz-4076781?quizResult=84308d0b"target"_blank">www.thoughtco.com</a>

<p>Results of Test Two</p>

<p>You got: You Are a Strong Tactile Learner!

As a tactile learner, you like to get active as you learn.

If you are a tactile learner, you probably do best when you participate in
activities that get you out of your chair. You remember things best once you've
experienced them.

You don't understand things so well if you only read about them.
Reading usually bores you. You may talk with your hands. You might have been
called a poor listener or a fidgety student, because sitting too long makes you
nuts! You probably sit in the back of the class. You can benefit by using role
playing methods when you study. You could also benefit from making your own
flashcards.</p>

<h2>Test Three</h2>

<h3>Verbal reasoning test<h3>

Link to test
<a href="https://my-personality-test.com/big-5"target"_blank">www.my-personality-test.com</a>

<p>Results: -</p>

<h5>Openness to Experience – Medium Characteristics</h5>

<p>You have a medium level of openness to experience. At times, you can be very
creative, curious, and adventurous. At other times, you prefer routine. You are
able to find a great balance between ideas and practicality.

You typically are a good problem-solver. When you are faced with a problem, you
consider the tried-and true methods, but are also able to think outside the box.
You are able to handle whatever life throws at you.

People who are moderate in openness to experience are well-suited for careers
that balance creativity with stability – for example, journalism, photography,
graphic design, or research.</p>

<h5>Extraversion – Low Characteristics</h5>

<p>You are an introvert. While you enjoy spending time with others, you truly get
your energy by spending time by yourself. Spending too much time around others
leaves you feeling tired and drained. Others describe you as thoughtful and
quiet. Being the center of attention usually makes you feel uncomfortable.

You may not be a social butterfly, but you do an amazing job building
relationships with others. You find that you typically have a few friends whom
you are very close with, rather than many acquaintances. The relationships you
have with others are usually very long-lasting.

Others would describe you as very detail-oriented. You listen more than you
speak, and are thoughtful about whatever you say. In stressful situations, you
always seem calm and level-headed.

Introverts do best in jobs that allow them to spend most of the day alone. If
put into a job that requires too much time spent with others, introverts leave
work feeling completely exhausted. The best jobs for introverts include those
involving art, technology, or science – such as a photographer, lab worker, or
computer programmer.</p>

<h5>Neuroticism – Medium Characteristics</h5>

<p>You are moderately neurotic – at times, you can be anxious or emotional, while
at other times, you are relaxed and calm. Your mood may fluctuate slightly,
depending on the day.

You describe yourself as a realist. You don’t tend to be overly optimistic or
overly pessimistic, and are able to view problems clearly and realistically,
considering many factors.

Your neurotic traits – such as worrying about how you are perceived by others –
make you successful in your career. Coupled with your ability to remain
level-headed, you have a great balance of traits to be a natural leader. You try
to do your best at everything, even if there doesn’t seem to be anything in it
for you. People who are moderate in neuroticism make great employees and
supervisors.

People who are moderately neurotic typically do well in helping careers, such as
counselling or public service.</p>

<h5>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>

<p>I am extraverted but I also can be introverted and listen to people when and
where needed. I am willing to follow people more, but I can show leadership when
I need to. I enjoy practical learning and hands on learning. I enjoy learning in
groups. I am also a visual learner not so much textbook based learner.</p>

<h5>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>

<p>These results can influence behaviour in a team by allowing me to know my
strengths and weaknesses when working in a team. It allows me to know what tasks
I would be best at completing and what role I would fit into within the team. I
learn best by experiencing them.</p>

<h5>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>

<p>These results are only a guide not gospel, but they should be noted down and
realised when forming a team as I would perform best by not being a leader, a
follower would suit me best. I am happy to follow direction and then be
delegated a task, I will then complete it.</p>

                            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
<hr style="border:2px solid teal"> </hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>My project idea is the production of an app on a mobile device that enables the
user, by the touch of a button on their mobile device to let a bus driver know
when you would like to get off the bus. This app will be user friendly, the app
will help with the communication barrier between passenger and driver and also
will help eliminate disease by only the user pressing their phone {and not a
button that many people have touched throughout the day on the bus}.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>My motivation for the project is that as a young adult I utilised the public
transport in Sydney daily, I remember thinking when I was on the transport. I
wonder how many people have touched the buttons or pulled the cord when to get
off the bus each day. I wonder how much disease and germs were on these buttons?
This project interested me as statistics show that were published by Granwal on
8th October 2020, that there are around 18.6 million smartphone users in
Australia. This figure is set to grow to 21.5 million in 2025. This figure is
mind blowing. I think there is potentially a huge market right across Australia
for an app as mentioned above. Using raspberry Pi technology will be cheap and
easily accessible and using assembled technology alongside my app and will
potentially solve the solution of how the individual mobile device will link to
each bus and not interfere with other mobile devices and users on the bus at the
time.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The features of my app will by unique in that the user will utilise app
individually on each mobile device simultaneously whilst the bus is in motion.
There will be a led on the bus that lights up which is connected to the
internet, bus permitting with Wi-Fi? Each led will be registered to a bus number
on a database. When the user opens the app they enter the bus number, then when
it is time to get off the bus they press the button on their mobile device, that
light turns on indicating to the driver that they need to stop. My app will be
simply called NEXT STOP.</p>

<h2>Tools and technologies</h2>

<p>A mobile device will be crucial to the execution of this app, it will be user
friendly and be available for download on android or apple devices.

The app will involve connecting a led to the internet. Registering each light
with a bus number in a database. When the user opens the app, they enter the bus
number and when the press the button on their mobile device the light turns on
letting the driver know you would like to get off the bus. The internet
connected light will require a sim card to ensure mobile internet connection is
maintained. Buses now use Wi-Fi, but I will have to check this technology on
buses.

I will use Kotlin for android as it seems to be more user friendly than Java for
android. There is also the possibility of installing raspberry pi’s, this will
help the light turn on when the passenger would like to get off the bus.
Raspberry Pi’s are small credit card computers that will help in the control of
the app and turn the light on the bus when needed.<p>

<h2>Skills required</h2>

<p>Skills required are humans to be proactive and use the app instead of the
buttons that are built into the bus structure. The app software will need to be
written, I was thinking of using Kotlin for android and not Java, Kotlin is user
friendly, fast, and easy to use. Special hardware that will need to be utilised
would be led light, a raspberry pi and a sim card to ensure mobile device
internet connection. Once the app is made, the rest of the project should be
relatively easy, but I think the hardest part might be knowing how to connect
the led to the bus and the database and getting the mobile phone to work with
the led.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>If my project is successful, the outcome will talk to the state transport
companies and discuss the potential of installing my project in a couple of
busses (and trains) to see how app will work in real time. Of course, like any
project, I will encounter problems and hopefully find solutions to the problems.
The impact of the development of my app is that it will stop or slow down the
spread of disease on those buttons that everyone presses on public transport. I
thought of the idea because we are all in this uncertain covid riddled world
that we can not escape. A world in which we can only live in and accept change
daily.</p>
